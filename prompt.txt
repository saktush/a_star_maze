Great. Let's write a python app, that can solve any maze with following conditions:
1. on input we got .png file with mase (the picture will be provided locally, do not ask me for it)
1.1 start position pixel is rgb(255,0,0)
1.2 goal position pixel is rgb(0,0,255)
1.3 waals in mase are pixels rgb(0,0,0)
1.4 empty pixels can be rgb(255.255.255) or something close

2. our goal is to show how astar search algorithm find a way from start to goal point with now crossing walls of the maze
2.1 each visited pixel becane more green (up to 255) every time it visited
2.2 if some pixels visited more than 255 times - the became more red (up to 255) every visit

3. The maze is solved only when cursor from start moves to goal point using astar algorithm
3.1 if here is no start or goal position in maze picture - show notification and ask for other picture
3.2 if there is no way from start to goal position without crossing the wall - show notification and ask for other picture

4. on output save [current_date_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_solve].gif file with solving process - step by step animation to /data folder

5. application window: main window with select (load) file button used to load image and "start" / "stop" buttons
6. solving process should be visible in separate window and show full size image of maze with all changes in realtime

Use cv2 anp numpy and helpful other  libraries for main logic
Use tkinter to build flexible user interface.

The application should work well on Mac Os and windows, should be called a_star_maze

Do you have enough information to write this application?

answer only "yes" or  "no" and wait for further instructions
